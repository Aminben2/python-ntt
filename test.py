Write a Python script that performs the following tasks:

Generate a random integer between -10,000 and 10,000.
Extract the last digit of the number, considering the sign of the number (i.e., if the number is negative, the last digit should also be negative).
Print a message in the following format:
"Last digit of <number> is <last_digit> and is":
If the last digit is greater than 5, append "greater than 5".
If the last digit is equal to 0, append "0".
If the last digit is less than 6 and not 0, append "less than 6 and not 0".

Example Output:
If the random number is -9234, the output would be:


Last digit of -9234 is -4 and is less than 6 and not 0
If the random number is 9837, the output would be:

Last digit of 9837 is 7 and is greater than 5

Hereâ€™s how you can frame the exercise whose answer would be the code you provided:

Exercise:
Write a Python function named islower that performs the following task:

Check if a given character is a lowercase letter.
The function should take a single character as an argument.
It should return True if the character is a lowercase letter (a to z), and False otherwise.
Requirements:
Use the ord() function to determine the ASCII value of the character.
The ASCII values for lowercase letters range from 97 ('a') to 122 ('z').
Example Usage:
python
Copy code
print(islower('a'))  # Output: True
print(islower('Z'))  # Output: False
print(islower('g'))  # Output: True
print(islower('1'))  # Output: False

Write a Python function named uppercase that performs the following task:

    Convert and print a string in uppercase:
        The function should take a single string as an argument.
        It should convert all lowercase letters in the string to uppercase (without using Python's built-in upper() function).
        After converting the string, print the result on a single line without changing any non-letter characters.

Requirements:

    Use the ord() function to determine the ASCII value of each character.
    Convert lowercase letters ('a' to 'z') to their uppercase equivalents by subtracting 32 from their ASCII values.
    Print the string without adding any newlines or spaces between characters, except for the final newline at the end.

"""
Write a Python function named print_last_digit that performs the following task:

    Print the last digit of a given integer:
        The function should take a single integer as an argument (which can be positive or negative).
        It should calculate the last digit of the number by taking the absolute value and using the modulus operator.
        Print the last digit without a newline after it.
    Return the last digit as an integer.

Requirements:

    Use the abs() function to ensure the last digit is positive, regardless of whether the input number is positive or negative.
    Use the modulus operator (%) to extract the last digit.

Example Usage:

python

Write a Python script that performs the following task:

Print the alphabet in reverse order, starting from z to a, alternating between uppercase and lowercase letters.
The first letter printed should be z (lowercase), the second should be Y (uppercase), then x (lowercase), and so on.

Explanation:
The script uses the ord() function to get the ASCII values for z and a and iterates in reverse order.
It uses the chr() function to convert the ASCII values back to characters.
The variable i is used to toggle between uppercase and lowercase by adjusting the ASCII value by 32 when needed.
